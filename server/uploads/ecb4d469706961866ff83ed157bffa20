Theory for openings off base:

- Ad conditions
- Enemy jungle
- Wards
- Jungle position (enemy first, then your) 
- Mid top last

Question: 

How will the match-up go
How the wave needs to be managed for me to have optimal laning phase (3 wave crash), 

Laning:

Hold the middle bush
Against hook champions, block for adc
If playing melee, instead of pinching, on initial engage, move closer to your ADC (easier to body block)
Checklist after every recall/death
After deployment, divie the map into 2 parts and make the side preassured (clearing wards)
Plants have two purposes Get info and reduce vision. 
If I think my jungler will do something botside its good to start fight to make it divable
Its criminal to hit dragon as a support
Recalling while having wards is bad
ALWAYS ward first for weakside, then strongside

when weaker on mid: deploy through side pivot is the bot bush on either side
droping wards in bushes that you gonna walk is bad (if I can walk into that bush, Im not gonna ward it but rather ward deeper)
If Im in front of my jungler, I should sweep
Common vision lines and abuse them for creative wards

my wards are dictated by the turrets that are up
when clearing vision think more like what if I was in enemy support shoes

Practice:

Vision cones:
What is my goal

Opening out of base:
Am I aware of what wards are being dropped
In game play normally but try to pay attention after 2nd 3rd wave see which way enemy fogs

Dropping wards deeper:
If you face check you dont ward it,
Know vision lines
